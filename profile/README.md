# zkMatrixHQ

We are a Solana-focused engineering org building production-grade Web3 systems.

This org started with our project for the **Solana Cypherpunk Hackathon** — an early prototype of an undercollateralized lending protocol. The hackathon version was rushed for demo purposes. Now, we are rebuilding everything properly from scratch with a production mindset.

## Vision
To build robust, trust-minimized financial infrastructure on Solana that is:

- secure by design
- composable by default
- simple to integrate
- reliable under real-world conditions
- transparent in behavior and incentives

We are not optimizing for hype or speed — we are optimizing for correctness, longevity, and real users.

## What we build
All repositories in this org are strictly related to:

- Solana smart contracts (Anchor / Rust)
- On-chain finance primitives
- Cryptography & protocol design
- Developer tooling for Solana
- Infrastructure and backend services around Solana programs

## Current focus
- Rebuilding the undercollateralized lending protocol
- Strong testing and auditing practices
- Security-first architecture
- Clean, maintainable, production-quality code

## Philosophy
We value:
- correctness over speed  
- simplicity over hacks  
- security over shortcuts  
- long-term design over demos
